		  <h3>Hey! I'm Preston!<hr></h3>
		  <p>I'm a rising senior at Lowell High School that loves to play chess with my friends! I also like programming on my free time! I've linked my chess.com profile below. If you need to rewind and relax, then I'm your perfect opponent! However, wins don't come for free ;) </p>
			 <p>When it comes to programming, I love to develop anything that comes to mind. Whether it be a game on Unity, a website on Replit, or making the User Interface for APIs, the ability to let my creativity run free never ceases to excite me! Feel free to connect with me on my LinkedIn and we can build a monumental project together!</p>
			<p>Or maybe I'm just someone you want to talk to! If there's one thing I ABSOLUTELY LOVEEE, it's talking. It doesn't even have to be about anything important 😂 . </p>
		<h3>Chess and Calmness? Go Figure.<hr></h3>
		<p>Contrary to thought, chess can be a very relaxing pastime! As Beth Harmon from the Queen's Gambit puts it, "Chess doesn't always have to be competitive. Sometimes it can also be beautiful." And I couldn't agree more. I imagine chess as this metaphor for life. In chess, even the best of the best make mistakes. For many, those mistakes can weigh down on you and negatively influence future decisions. However, it is those who take the time to analyze their mistakes and learn from them that improve in the sport. By learning from our past mistakes, and focusing on the present, the possibilities are limitless. Furthermore, chess isn't that high stakes intellectual game many think of it to be. Chess also has a nice social atmosphere to it. Below, I've linked a prime example of how fun and engaging chess can be. Casual play exists, and if you want an enthusiastic chess opponent like the one shown below, my chess profile is always open to you!  </p>
